# Rocket Report – Master Roadmap

## Vision
A baseball betting site that ingests 5+ years of MLB data, runs multiple prediction models (moneyline underdog, run-line spread, over/under totals), and surfaces daily picks with confidence scores and transparent model-performance metrics.

## Things You May Not Have Considered

### Data & Modeling
- ✅ **Weather data** – Wind speed/direction at each park significantly affects totals. Several APIs (OpenWeatherMap, Visual Crossing) provide historical & forecast data.
- ✅ **Umpire tendencies** – Home-plate umpire strike zones affect run totals. Retrosheet and Baseball Savant track umpire data.
- ✅ **Lineup availability timing** – Lineups are confirmed ~2-3 hours before first pitch. Picks generated before lineups drop carry higher uncertainty.
- ✅ **Injury reports / IL tracking** – Pitcher scratches flip games dramatically. Integrate an injury feed.
- ✅ **Ballpark factors** – Coors Field vs. Oracle Park yields wildly different totals. Fangraphs publishes annual park factors.
- ✅ **Platoon splits** – A left-heavy lineup vs. a lefty starter deserves completely different projections.
- ✅ **Bullpen usage / fatigue** – Back-to-back heavy bullpen usage lowers reliever effectiveness. Model rest days.
- ✅ **Travel & scheduling** – West-coast-to-east-coast travel, day games after night games, and long road trips cause fatigue.

### Product & UX
- **Mobile-first design** – Most bettors check picks on their phone.
- **Push notifications / email alerts** – "Your top pick starts in 30 min."
- **Historical pick ledger** – Transparent, auditable track record page showing every past pick and result.
- **Odds comparison widget** – Show real-time odds from multiple sportsbooks (DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM) so users can line-shop.
- **Unit-based bankroll tracker** – Let users log their bets and see P/L over time.
- **Dark mode** – Table-heavy sites benefit enormously from dark mode.
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)** – Color-blind-safe confidence indicators.

### Legal & Compliance
- **State-by-state legality** – Some states prohibit paid picks; others require disclaimers.
- **Responsible gambling disclaimers** – Required by most affiliate programs.
- **Age verification** – If monetized via subscriptions or affiliate links.

### Monetization (optional)
- **Freemium model** – Free O/U picks; paid tier for full slate + confidence scores.
- **Affiliate links** – Partner with sportsbooks for referral revenue.
- **Tip jar / Patreon** – Community-supported.

## Tech Stack Recommendation

| Layer | Tool | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| Language | Python 3.11+ | Dominant in data science & MLB libraries |
| Data store | CSV / Parquet (primary) | Simple, portable, version-controllable with Git |
| Data store (optional) | PostgreSQL | Use if data grows beyond flat-file comfort |
| Task scheduler | APScheduler | Run daily data pulls & model inference |
| ML framework | scikit-learn → XGBoost / LightGBM | Start simple, graduate to gradient boosting |
| Dashboard | Streamlit | All-Python, rapid prototyping, built-in charts |
| Charting | Plotly / Altair (via Streamlit) | Interactive, publication-quality visuals |
| Backend API (optional) | FastAPI | Use if external consumers need JSON endpoints |
| Deployment | Docker → Streamlit Cloud / Railway | Containers for reproducibility |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Already on GitHub |
| Version control | GitHub | Code, data schemas, and model artifacts |
